👋 Hi, I’m @kevin2tec  
🔐 I’m interested in cybersecurity, ethical hacking, bug hunting, system development, and building tools that make tech safer.  
🌱 I’m currently diving deeper into red teaming, advanced vulnerability exploitation, and building full-stack security-focused applications — both mobile and web.  
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on cybersecurity research, anti-ransomware frameworks, OSINT tools, and innovative defense/offense projects.
